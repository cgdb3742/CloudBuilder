# CloudBuilder
The source code of a game about learning and creating. Created using Visual Studio 2017 for Windows, SFML 2.4.2 and pugixml 1.8.

I decided to learn C++ this summer and create a game to assess my understanding of this language. This repository shows part of the creation process.

I currently plan to work on it until I reach a playable state.

As I am a novice in both C++ and GitHub, I do not claim the files shared in this repository represent good practice for C++ or programming in general, nor do I claim they will work on any configuration.

Everything in this repository (including this readme) is heavily subject to change.

This project uses both C++ Standard Library and SFML for C++ Library, make sure both are installed before building.

The development is currently mainly focused on running the game on Windows, hopefully cross-platform support will be implemented later. In the meantime, if you use an other operating system, you will have to comment any reference to <windows.h> and related code in main.ccp and ClipboardControl.cpp.
