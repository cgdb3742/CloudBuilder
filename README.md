# CloudBuilder
The source code of a game about learning and creating. Created using Visual Studio 2017 for Windows, SFML 2.4.2 and pugixml 1.8.

I decided to learn C++ this summer and create a game to assess my understanding of this language. This repository shows part of the creation process.

I currently plan to work on it until I reach a playable state.

As I am a novice in both C++ and GitHub, I do not claim the files shared in this repository represent good practice for C++ or programming in general, nor do I claim they will work on any configuration.

Everything in this repository (including this readme) is heavily subject to change.
